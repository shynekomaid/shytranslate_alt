# alt_translate

Fast as water in the toilet bowl, internet dependent ru<->en translator, with settings and notifications, the functions of which can be linked to the hotkeys.

Based on [translate-shell](https://www.soimort.org/translate-shell/).

# Instalations
```
git clone http://bitrek.video:11300/shyneko/alt_translate.git
cd alt_translate
chmod +x *
```

# Usages

```
./autotrans2ru.sh

I suggest binding to hotkeys like ```alt+t``` and ```shift+alt+t```
